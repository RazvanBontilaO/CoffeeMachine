# ☕ Coffee Machine Simulator

A beginner-level **Java console application** that simulates a real coffee machine.  
The program lets users **buy coffee, fill supplies, take money, and check the machine's resources** — all through simple text commands.

Inspired by [Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/) learning projects.
